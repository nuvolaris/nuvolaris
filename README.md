# IMPORTANT!
Please note all the development moved to [Apache OpenServerless](https://github.com/apache/openserverless)

# Welcome to Nuvolaris!

Nuvolaris is an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) project to build a complete and portable [Serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) environment that runs in every [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Technically it is a distribution of [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org) released under the [Apache Licence 2.0](LICENSE) (like OpenWhisk itself), that includes other services out of the box.

We want to build a *complete* distribution of a serverless environment that:

- It is easy to install and manage.
- Potentially runs in every Kubernetes.
- It is tested regularly against a set of supported Kubernetes environments.
- Includes a (possibly large) number of integrated services.

This is the main differentiation from Apache OpenWhisk, as it only provides a basic engine for serverless. Our goals are described in our [**roadmap**](docs/ROADMAP.md) document to read about.

## TL;DR

If you are in a hurry, here a few starting points:

- Read the [documentation](https://nuvolaris.github.io).
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nuvolaris/nuv/releases) of the CLI to install and use Nuvolaris.
- Check our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPt5hk7qcOkESjB7kii1byw) for our trainings and community calls.
- Discuss with us on our [Dicourse](https://nuvolaris.discourse.group/) forum.
